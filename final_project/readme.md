Hello! And welcome to my very simple neural network

it is pretty robust in that one can add as many layers as one wants (I mean I guess it will eventually just run out of memory or some such) and as many nuerons to each layer as you want.

So that part is cool, at the moment it can only have one final output neuron though, so only two classes can be guessed at

also the code is rather crude, we are just using two functions
